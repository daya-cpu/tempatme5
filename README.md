5. Collaboration and Remote Repositories
Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch onto the updated remote branch.

PROGRAM:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

git fetch
This command fetches the latest changes from the remote repository without automatically merging them into your local branches.

2. Rebase your local branch onto the updated remote branch:

Assuming you are currently on the branch you want to update (replace your-branch with the actual name of your branch):

git rebase origin/your-branch
This command applies your local commits on top of the changes fetched from the remote branch. If conflicts arise, Git will pause the rebase process and ask you to resolve them. Alternatively, you can use the interactive rebase to review and modify commits during the rebase:

git rebase -i origin/your-branch
This opens an editor where you can pick, squash, or edit individual commits.

3. Continue the rebase or resolve conflicts:

If conflicts occurred during the rebase, Git will prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, you can continue the rebase with:

git rebase --continue
If you decide to abort the rebase at any point, you can use:

git rebase --abort
4. Push the rebased branch to the remote repository:

After successfully rebasing your local branch, you may need to force-push the changes to the remote repository:

git push origin your-branch --force
Be cautious with force-pushing, especially if others are working with the same branch, as it rewrites the commit history. Now, your local branch is rebased onto the updated remote branch. Keep in mind that force-pushing should be done with caution, especially on shared branches, to avoid disrupting collaborative work.
### Collaboration and Remote Repositories

**Fetch the latest changes from a remote repository and rebase your local branch**

---

#### Step 1: Fetch the latest changes

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This downloads the latest updates from the remote repository without changing your local working branch.

---

#### Step 2: Rebase your local branch onto the updated remote branch

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

(Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name like `master` or `develop`.)

---

#### Alternative (single command)

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
```

This command first fetches the remote changes and then rebases your local commits on top of them.

---

#### If conflicts occur

```bash
git status
# resolve conflicts
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
```

To cancel the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --abort
```

---

#### Purpose

* Keeps commit history clean and linear
* Avoids unnecessary merge commits
* Helps maintain smooth collaboration in team projects

This explanation is **suitable for exams, labs, and interviews**.
